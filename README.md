### Hi there 👋

My name is Londyn Crowe

**Pronouns**: she/her.

I’m currently working on finishing my final semester at ETSU. I am also doing some game development with my brother.

I'm having to learn some ARM assembly and C for my Computer Architecture class.

My current favorite hobby is playing the piano, but I am new to the instrument.

My email is **crowela@etsu.edu**.
